% This file should contain a short summary of the trajectory analysis/optimal control tool and models

To model the trajectory of the UAM concept vehicles under consideration, the analysis tool Dymos which is written in the OpenMDAO framework was selected.\cite{falck2019optimal}
The primary capability provided by Dymos is a modular, general approach for determining optimal control schedules.
The optimal control capability applies the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) collocation scheme which allows for analysis with relatively few function evaluations compared to other methods.\cite{falckpointer2016}
This collocation scheme discretizes the mission into a number of segments within which a polynomial is used to specify the value of each control or  state parameter over time.
The polynomials for each state equation are defined by a set of cardinal nodes which are varied to satisfy the equations of motion at interior nodes on the function.  
By formulating the control problem in this way it can be solved with nonlinear programming approaches to determine the optimal control schedule.\cite{falckpointer2016}
Dymos has been used to evaluate the trajectory of UAM concepts coupled with acoustic analyses\cite{falck2018multi}.
