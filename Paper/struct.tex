% This file should contain a short summary of the structures/mass analysis tool and models


Mass estimates are broken down and calculated in the following categories,
listed here by weight in descending order

\begin{itemize}

    \item engine  2055.6 lbs
    \item fuselage 1129.2 lbs
    \item wing 821.8 lbs
    \item motor 810.2 lbs
    \item drive system 715 lbs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item gearbox
        \end{itemize}
    \item fuel system 689.7 lbs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item battery
        \end{itemize}
    \item propellers 502.6 lbs
    \item landing gear 477.4 lbs
    \item cables 300 lbs
    \item tail 110.9 lbs
    \item inverter 75lbs
\end{itemize}

Engine weight was calculated based on a regression sensitive to massflow.
Drive system weight includes gearbox, rotor break, and shaft. It is derived from NDARC AFDD83 regresion based on 30 aircraft.
Fuel system weight includes tanks and supporting structures, and is based on a 15 aircraft regression.
Fuselage is based on AFDD84 NDARC universal body weight model.
Inverter weight is based on a linear regression of XX flightweight inverters.
Motor weight is based on a linear regression of XX aircraft developmental motors.
Landing gear and alighting structures are based on a regression of 28 aircraft.
Propeller weight is based on the NDARC AFDD82 model using 35 aircraft to determine hub and blade weights
Tail weight is the AFDD82 NDARC model, consistening of horizontal, vertical and tail rotor components.
Wing weight comes from OpenAeroStruct (Jasa)
Battery weight is dependent on energy capacity and energy density.
Cable weight was calculated based on a regression sensitive to current.
